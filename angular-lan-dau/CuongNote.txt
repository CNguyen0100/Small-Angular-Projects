*ngFor                  | repeat the same markup for a collection of objects (ng-repeat)

  - use a component as a child Component
      just need include the tag of child component
  - pass data into the child Component
      @Input decorator
      declare input metadata @Input()
      pass data []


modules
  -   decorator adds metadata to the class immediately
  -   4 keys: declaration, imports , providers, and bootstrap.
      + declarations      | specifies the components that are defined in this modules.
                        | you have to declare component in a NgModule before you can use them in your template.
      + imports         | describes which dependencies this module has.
      + providers       | is used for dependency injection.
                        | to make a service available to be injected throughout our application.
      + bootstrap       | tells Angular that when this module is used to bootstrap an app, we need to load the AppComponent component as the top-level components
